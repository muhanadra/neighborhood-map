        <article><h3>Before Sunset Filming locations</h3><h3>About Neighborhood-map</h3><p>This application is based on google maps js api, It loads and center a map in Paris while using markers to show us the lovely roads that Jesse and Celine walked in during the film.</p>
<h3>How to run the application</h3><p>To Start this application click <a href="http://neo0rabie.github.io/neighborhood-map/">here</a>.</p>
<h1>Discalimer</h1><p>Most of the data in the app is not correct but I will make sure to fix this in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Get In touch.</h3><p>If you want to see also filming locations of the other parts of this trilogy, Before sunrise and Before Midnight. Just let me know, if there's enough demand - mainly one or two other guys/gals. I will be happy to do it. Hope you're a fan of this Movie and in your next visit to Paris you will enjoy some, if not all of these locations.</p>
<h3>Credits</h3><ul>
